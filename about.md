## About

**Economics of Risky Health Behaviors** is a Special Interest Group (SIG) of the International Health Economics Association (IHEA). The objective of this SIG is to bring together an international community of researchers to build health economics capacity and to advance economic research that contributes to our understanding of the causes and consequences of risky health behaviors, as well as the effectiveness of policies and interventions designed to modify and reduce risky health behaviors. The activities of the SIG are centered on the **Virtual Seminar on the Economics of Risky Health Behaviors (VERB)**, which is held monthly during the academic year and provides a forum for researchers to present and discuss research, encourages interaction and collaboration among researchers in different countries, and facilitates the sharing of information about research taking place in different national contexts. In addition, the Economics of Risky Health Behaviors SIG aims to encourage international research collaboration, increase the visibility of early-career scholars, and support them in improving their research, thereby strengthening the global research community working on the economics of risky health behaviors.
